# üí´ About Me:
Engineer by skill and creator at heart, I've spent years designing, developing, and deploying software. I've contributed to projects across various fields, from e-commerce to container shipping planning, from fintech to food delivery. Whether in a startup where the tech team could fit in a single car or at a tech giant serving millions of users, I've been passionate about building solutions that make an impact.<br><br>Thanks to my career, I had the opportunity to embark on an exciting journey of migration. I left my beloved üá¶üá∑ Argentina to embrace new experiences, meet incredible people, and immerse myself in the rich culture of üá≥üá± The Netherlands.<br><br>I'm currently a software engineer at Ahold Delhaize, where I focus on modernizing internal tools, delivering high-quality software, and driving business value at a rapid pace. Before this, I worked at Routescanner, helping customers reduce CO2 emissions by optimizing their trade lanes with our innovative engine. I've also contributed to other notable organizations like Mercado Libre, Ual√°, and Rappi.<br><br>I also dedicate time to tutoring university students in programming, databases, and testing.
